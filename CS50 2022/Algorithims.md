# Introduction

Today we'll be focusing on [ Algorithms ](#Algorithms) which solve problems with arrays. It turns out a computer can't look at all the elements at once.

# Algorithms

# Searching

# Big O Notation

# Common Running Times

# Asymptotic Notation

# Searching Lockers

- On stage we have seven lockers with closed doors, with numbers hidden behind them. Since a computer can only look at one element in an array at a time, we can only open one door at a time as well.

- if we want to look for the number zero,for example we would have to open one door at a time and if we didnt know anything about the numbers behind the doors, the simplest algorithm would be goinf from legt to right.

- This algorithm, **Linear-Search**, would be correct but not very efficient,we might write pseudocode with:
